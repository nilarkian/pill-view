* embedded ` ```base ` blocks inside Markdown notes

## What this plugin does

* Renders a row of **pill tabs** above a Bases view
* Each tab maps directly to a Base **view name** (Table, List, custom views, etc.)
* Clicking a tab switches the active view immediately
* Works consistently for:

  * standalone `.base` files
  * embedded Bases inside Markdown previews
